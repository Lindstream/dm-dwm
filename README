Lindstreams Dream Machine DWM config
==============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X. 

Think I've found my ultimate patchset, lets roll.. 

Patches
----------------------------
* dwmfifo - done
  Best thing since sliced bread, this patch adds a FIFO command/controller (/tmp/dwm.fifo) to dwm that allows you controll keybind actions through CLI.

* hide vacant tags - done
  Pretty self-explainatory :)

* statusallmons - done
  Makes the statusbar available to all displays.
  thinking about switching to: http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/multimon

* runorraise - done
  Allows you to map frequently used apps to a key combo that will launch the application if it's not already running - otherwise bring the running session into focus. Great stuff to use with browsers and notes.

* notitle - done
  Who need titles anyway?

* save_floats - done
  Makes dwm remember the floating position and window size before things are tiled, and restores them appropriately.

  Nowamore nicknamed htile

  Adds an “iscentered” rule to automatically center clients on the current monitor.

  Adds a few more colors to dwm's palette.

  Super + ShiftR takes you back to your master client.

* uselessgaps- done
  Adds the possibillity to gap windows, also takes care of border in monocle and fullscreen mode.

* viewontag - done
  Follow a window to the tag it's being moved to, can't really decide on this one - option is set in config.h

  There's something annoying about not being able to toggle that last tag out of view..

  Hinders accidental termination of clients
