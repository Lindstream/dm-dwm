Lindstreams DWM config
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X. 

Think I've found my ultimate patchset, lets roll.. 

Patches
----------------------------
* dwmfifo - done
  Best thing since sliced bread, this patch adds a FIFO command/controller (/tmp/dwm.fifo) to dwm that allows you controll keybind actions through CLI.

* hide vacant tags - done
  Pretty self-explainatory :)

* statusallmons - done
  Makes the statusbar available to all displays.
  thinking about switching to: http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/multimon

* runorraise - done
  Allows you to map frequently used apps to a key combo that will launch the application if it's not already running - otherwise bring the running session into focus. Great stuff to use with browsers and notes.

* notitle - done
  Who need titles anyway?

* save_floats - done
  Makes dwm remember the floating position and window size before things are tiled, and restores them appropriately.

* bottom stack - done
  Nowamore nicknamed htile

* center - done
  Adds an “iscentered” rule to automatically center clients on the current monitor.

* urgent & float colors - done
  Adds a few more colors to dwm's palette.

* focusmaster - done
  Super + ShiftR takes you back to your master client.




* better borders - wip
  Removes borders when there are only one window visible, when a single app is fullscreen or the same width of the display.




* occupiedcol
* uselessgaps
